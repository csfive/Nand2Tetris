# Project 01: Elementary Logic Gates

A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc.,
as well as on their bitwise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine). In this
project you will build a typical set of basic logic gates. These gates form the elementary building
blocks from which you will build the computerâ€™s CPU and RAM chips in later projects.

Below we describe the tools, resources, and implementation tips needed for completing project 1.
